Routing conventions
1) all routes must live inside the app folder
2) route files must be names either page.js or page.tsx
3) each folder represents a segment of the url path

when these conventions are followed the files automatically become available as a route


metadata rules

both layout and page file can export metadata. layout meta data applies to all its pages and page meta data only applies to that specific page
Meta data follows a top down level starting from root level
when meta deta exists in multiple places along a route they merge together with page meta data overriding layout metadata for matching properties
